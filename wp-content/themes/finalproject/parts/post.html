    Galen possessed an unusually strong connection to the Force. His raw power
    as a toddler was such that Vader mistook his Force signature for that of a
    Jedi Master who far exceeded his father, Kento Marek, in power, even
    managing to telekinetically disarm the Dark Lord as they attempted to strike
    his father down.
